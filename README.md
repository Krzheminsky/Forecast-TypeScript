# Forecast

Before using the Forecast application, the author notes: the Forecast application IS NOT AN OFFICIAL SOURCE for obtaining calculation data, but only helps to quickly calculate and visualize on the map the place and area of ​​the accident, the depth of the spread of primary and secondary clouds, the area of ​​the ZMHZ.

Before starting work, go to the main page with a map of the area. Calculations should be started by filling in the initial data: choice of chemical substance, degree of vertical stability, aggregate state, etc. For the correct operation of the application, before clicking the "Calculate" button, all "Output data" fields must be filled. The height of the pallet should be indicated as 0 - if there is no pallet or piles. Do not forget to indicate the direction of the wind.

The value of the terrain influence factor should be determined based on the value of the complex indicator (appendices 5 and 6 of the methodology). Usually, this indicator is 0.5 for forest-steppe type of vegetation and plain undulating type of relief.

After filling in the fields in the "Output data" section, click the "Calculate" button. Calculation data will appear in the "Calculation results" section. It will also be possible to view "Interim calculations" and "Reference information on NKR".

Next - work with the map. Use the mouse to select the location of the accident on the map and press the left key. The map will display ZMHZ and primary and secondary clouds. If you click on them with the left mouse button, the main calculations will be displayed.

After superimposing the accident zones on the map, you can proceed with calculations regarding possible losses, fill out the appropriate forms in the section "To calculate possible losses" and click "Calculate".

I remind you:

for use in official documents of calculations regarding the consequences of the spill (release) of hazardous chemicals during accidents at chemically hazardous facilities and transport, please use the order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine dated November 29, 2019 No. 1000 "On the approval of the Methodology..."
in order to determine the actual ZCHZ, the calculated data obtained are refined by conducting chemical exploration.
